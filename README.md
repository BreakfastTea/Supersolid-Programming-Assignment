# Supersolid Programming Assignment.

A simple node.js web service to handle the back-end for a game involving the
use of palindromes.

## Core Functionality

- User enters name and word
- If word is a palindrome (same backwards as forwards), then a high score
is recorded. (based on string length).
- Numbers are allowed
- Scores are persisted in memory.
- Score does not increase cumulatively, each score is independent.
- Multiple players may have the same word.
